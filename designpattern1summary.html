<h1>Design Pattern 1: Menu Page</h1>
<h2>What:</h2>
<p>The page is filled with links to other parts of the website where the content is located. The links are well named so that the user can easily find what they are looking for. There should be no other significant content on the page.</p>
<h2>When:</h2>
<p>The menu page should be used when you want to show a table of contents as your homepage or starting screen, so that the user can easily get to the content on your site without distractions. Mobile apps and sites are well suited for this type of page because of their small screens. A menu page should only be used when the following criteria are met otherwise a different layout would probably be better suited.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The purpose of the site is clear to users without any explanation</li>
    <li>Anyone using the site knows where to go to get what they want</li>
    <li>News, updates or features are of little to no importance to the user
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Why:</h2>
<p>The entire screen can be used to direct users to their desired page with minimal distractions.</p>
<h2>How:</h2>
<p>For mobile devices, make links large enough to tap while keeping the list short with a simple hierarchy.<br/>For full-size sites, make sure the links are labeled concisely. Balance length with description so that you are getting the most out of each word or thumbnail. Make sure the links are organized in some fashion, either in categories, chronologically or into hierarchies. A search box might also be appropriate as well as some sort of attention drawer, but make sure it wonâ€™t be an annoyance to your users.
